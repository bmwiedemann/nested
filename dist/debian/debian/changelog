nested (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Footnotes support! Works great, but it lags a bit the 
    publishing process :(
  * Several small bugs corrected.
  * Corrected a bug that prevented the last child of any 
    subsection to be deleted.
  * Corrected a bug that prevented from rendering PDF when 
    a code block with option is present (e.g: C-Sharp block).
  * Corrected a bug that prevented to save a file (Save as) 
    to the same folder where the source file was.
  * Corrected a bug that prevented from loading filters for 
    all the targets but the last.
  * Linebreak filters are now a pre-filters, not post-filters, 
    so they should play nice with other txt2tags markup.
  * Image positioning is working now.
  * The website was added to the Nested repository.
  * Help menu now links to that documentation.
  * .t2t file association on Windows.
  * User is now able to easily find the Nested user folder.
