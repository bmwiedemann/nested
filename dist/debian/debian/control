Description: specialized editor for structured documents
 Nested is a specialized editor focused on creating structured documents such 
 as reports, publications, presentations, books, etc. It is designed to help the
 user concentrate on writing content without been distracted by format or 
 markup. It offers a rich WYSIWYM interface where the user writes plain text 
 with a lightweight markup language.
 .
 Basic users are assisted with extensive examples, formatting buttons, a simple 
 image gallery per document, assisted internal and external links, section based
 layout and easy publishing options in HTML, LaTeX or PDF. Power users will like
 the advanced pre-processing and post-processing options, advanced theming, 
 version control systems compatibility, LaTeX formulas support, a complete set
 of keyboard shortcuts, among others.
 .
 Nested separates content from presentation and publishing option, so same 
 content can be presented as a HTML web page, a rich standard-compliant HTML 
 presentation, a IEEE journal publication, a beautiful PDF book, etc. Nested 
 files are plain text so they can be used with common version control systems.
