= Translate =[translate]

You can help translating Nested to your language or to the languages 
you know. You can help by translating the Nested Software interface 
and/or the documentation, that is, the included examples, templates, 
manual and/or website.

== Application ==[application]

%html% '''
%html% <div style="float: right;text-align: right;">
%html%   <a target="_blank" 
%html%      style="text-decoration:none; color:black; font-size:66%"
%html%      href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/nested/resource/nested-application/"
%html%      title="See more information on Transifex.net">Top translations: nested Â» nested-application</a><br/>
%html%   <img src="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/nested/resource/nested-application/chart/image_png"/><br/>
%html% </div>
%html% '''

You can translate online the main Nested application via the 
Transifex website. Visit:

	https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/nested/

Alternatively, you can download the latest POT/PO files from 
Transifex (or from [here http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/l10n/nested.pot]) 
and then email it back to us.

== Documentation ==[documentation]

You can help translating the Nested included examples, templates,
manual and/or website. All of those are in Nested file format 
(known as txt2tags, *.t2t).

You need to download the ``*.t2t`` source files, edit them with Nested 
or any other plain text editor and save them with the following format:

```
	Filename.lang.t2t
```

**e.g.**: If the source file name is ``Presentation.t2t`` and you're translating 
it to Brazil Portuguese you need rename it to ``Presentation.pt_BR.t2t``. If 
your system is configured in Brazil Portuguese, Nested will try to load
files with ``*.pt_BR.t2t`` extension, if is not available, then it will try 
``*.pt.t2t``, if that one is also unavailable Nested will fallback to the 
included English ``*.t2t`` file.

Remember, always verify that your language is not already included first before 
starting a new translation.

**Examples**

- [Code.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/nested/examples/Code/]
- [Footnotes.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/nested/examples/Footnotes/]

- [Presentation.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/nested/examples/Presentation/]


**Templates**

- [WebQuest.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/nested/templates/WebQuest/] (Spanish->English translation required)


**Manual**

- [Manpage.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/nested/examples/Manpage/] (Used on GNU/Linux OS only)


**Website**

- [About.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/website/content/]
- [Screenshots.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/website/content/]

- [Participate.t2t http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/website/content/]


If you want to publish any website page correctly you need to download 
the [images http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/website/content/images/] 
and the [website theme http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk/website/theme/]. 
Then, copy the //WebsiteTheme// folder to your Nested themes folder 
(``File -> My Nested Folder -> themes``).

= Extend =[extend]

= Hacking and patching =[hacking_and_patching]

Patches and enhancements are always welcome! To get the source code run:

%html% ''' <div style="font-size: 17px; text-align: center;">

```
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nestededitor/code/trunk nested
```

%html% ''' </div>

Or browse it here: http://sourceforge.net/p/nestededitor/code/

Once you have downloaded the repository you will find the list of dependencies and
how to launch Nested from source in the **``README.txt``** file. Nested is
programmed with [Python http://python.org/], using [PyGtk http://www.pygtk.org/] 
for the GUI and [txt2tags http://txt2tags.org/] as the backend.

In the repository you will find the following tree:

- **``dist/``** : Scripts and files required to package Nested to the different 
  platforms: Ubuntu, Debian, Windows, etc.
- **``graphics/``** : Source files of the graphics used by Nested 
  ([SVG http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics] files).
- **``l10n/``** : Localization files for Nested. This folder includes a script 
  to extract translation strings from source code, a script to compile translation 
  files, the localization files ([``*.po`` files http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext])
  and the main localization template file (``*.pot`` file). See [Translate #translate]
  for more information.
- **``nested/``** : This folder holds the Python scripts that compose the Nested
  application. In particular, the important files are:
 - **``gui.glade``** : [Glade http://glade.gnome.org/] file that holds all the GUI.
 - **``nested``** : Launch script. Does nothing more than launching the application.
 - **``nested_gui.py``** : This is the **MOST** important file, it holds the logic of the 
   entire application.
 - **``undo_buffer.py``** : A TextBuffer for PyGtk TextView with Undo/Redo capabilities.
 - **``markup_buffer.py``** : A TextBuffer for PyGtk TextView with syntax highlight capabilities.
 - **``custom_buffer.py``** : A TextBuffer for PyGtk TextView with txt2tags and BibTeX syntax 
   highlight capabilities and extended functionality.
 - **``spellcheck.py``** : Provides spell checking capabilities to PyGtk TextBuffers.
 - **``txt2tags.py``** : The slightly modified version of [txt2tags http://txt2tags.org/]
   library used by Nested. The header of this file enumerates the modifications made.
 - **``export.py``** : Handles the conversion of the user content to the requested
   target. Here you can find the default pre/post filters.
 - **``modules/``** : Several independent modules used by Nested.
  - **``bibmm/``** : Provides BibTeX handling.
  - **``locales/``** : Provides codes and names for countries (ISO 3166) and languages (ISO 639).
- **``website/``** : The source files for this entire website.
 - **``content``** : ``*.t2t`` source files and compiled examples.
 - **``extras``** : Some additional and specific files required to host this page in Sourceforge.
 - **``theme``** : HTML theme for Nested that gives the look and feel to this website.


Happy hacking ;)

= Packaging =[packaging]

Nested is packaged for several operating systems in several 
formats and deployment ways. If you want to access the files 
used to package Nested you need to get the development 
repository, that is, the source code file (.tar.gz) don't 
include them. See [Hacking and patching #hacking_and_patching] 
to know how to get it.

You will find the **dist** folder located in the root of the 
development repository, in it, you can find the files used for 
packaging.

== Deb ==[deb]

Nested is packaged for Debian and Ubuntu, which uses the **.deb** 
[file format ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)""] for 
distributing and installing Software. To create a Debian package do:

```
	cd dist/debian/
	./make_release.sh
```

The above //make_release.sh// script will create a //source release// 
archive in the //dist// folder, then, it will process that file and 
create a Debian source package and a Debian binary package. You can find
the specific Debian package files in ``dist/debian/debian``.

You need to edit the //make_release.sh// script to adapt it to your
needs, in particular you need to change the first lines with your data:

```
	export DEBFULLNAME="Your name"
	export DEBEMAIL="your@email.com"
```

To build the Debian package you need the following packages:

```
	sudo apt-get install devscripts build-essential fakeroot dh-make wget
```

== RPM ==[rpm]

Nested is packaged for Fedora and OpenSuse, which uses the **.rpm** 
file format for distributing and installing Software. 
%To create a RPM package do:
%
%```
%	cd dist/fedora/
%	./make_release.sh
%```

In ``dist/fedora/`` you can find the **.spec** file required to build the RPM package.

To get a source release package execute from the repository root:

```
	python setup.py sdist
```

This will create a source code distribution package in the //dist// folder.

== Exe ==[exe]

Nested is packaged for Windows XP, Vista and 7. Windows packaging
requires a complete and configured build system. Detailed instructions
on how to configure your system can be found here:

```
	dist/windows/build.txt
```

Nested is written in [Python http://python.org/] and uses 
[Gtk+ http://www.gtk.org/] for the GUI. The process of
creating the executable is called //freezing//. The packaging process 
consist of two steps:

+ Create the executable.
+ Create the installer.


Nested uses [NSIS http://nsis.sourceforge.net/] system to create
the installer.

Once you have your system configured you can package for Windows
just by executing:

```
	cd dist\windows
	make_release.bat
```
