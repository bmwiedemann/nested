Nested is a specialized editor focused on creating structured documents such
as reports, publications, presentations, books, etc. It is designed to help the
user concentrate on writing content without been distracted by format or 
markup. It offers a rich WYSIWYM interface where the user writes plain text 
with a lightweight markup language.

Basic users are assisted with extensive examples, formatting buttons, a simple 
image gallery per document, assisted internal and external links, section based
layout and easy publishing options in HTML, LaTeX or PDF. Power users will like
the advanced pre-processing and post-processing options, advanced theming, 
version control systems compatibility, LaTeX formulas support, a complete set
of keyboard shortcuts, among others.

Nested separates content from presentation and publishing option, so same 
content can be presented as a HTML web page, a rich standard-compliant HTML 
presentation, a IEEE journal publication, a beautiful PDF book, etc. Nested 
files are plain text so they can be used with common version control systems.

Nested was funded by the Consejo Nacional de Rectores ([CONARE http://www.conare.ac.cr/]) 
with the support of Universidad de Costa Rica, Universidad Nacional, 
Universidad Estatal a Distancia and Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica.
